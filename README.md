# Social Network Analysis with Python

This repository contains Python code for conducting social network analysis (SNA) on graphs. The code enables calculation of various metrics such as average path length, clustering coefficient, data distribution, and the influence of seed matrix using linear threshold and independent cascade models.

## Features

- **Average Path Length Calculation**: Calculate the average path length of a graph.
- **Clustering Coefficient Calculation**: Compute the clustering coefficient of nodes in a graph.
- **Data Distribution Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of data within the graph.
- **Influence of Seed Matrix**: Measure the influence of seed nodes using both linear threshold and independent cascade models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NetworkX library (`pip install networkx`)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/AnshitaKanthed/sna
